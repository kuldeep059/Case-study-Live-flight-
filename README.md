# Flight Tracking Project

This project is a web application for tracking flight details. It uses a React frontend and a Node.js backend, with MongoDB for data storage and Firebase for messaging. The application fetches flight details via APIs and displays them in an interactive UI.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing flight data
- **Firebase**: Platform for sending notifications and messages
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests

## Features

- Fetches and displays flight details from a public API
- Stores flight data in MongoDB
- Uses Firebase for sending notifications
- Interactive and responsive UI built with React

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- MongoDB
- Firebase CLI (optional, for advanced usage)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-tracking.git
    cd flight-tracking
    ```

2. **Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    cd flight-backend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3. **Set up MongoDB:**
    - Start your MongoDB server.
    - Import the provided MongoDB Compass Database file if necessary.

4. **Configure Firebase:**
    - Set up a Firebase project and obtain the configuration file.
    - Replace the Firebase config in the project with your own.

5. **Run the backend server:**
    ```sh
    cd flight-backend
    node server.js
    ```

6. **Run the frontend:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

### Usage

- Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
- The main page will display flight details fetched from the API.
- Use the search functionality to look up specific flights.
- Receive notifications via Firebase messaging (if configured).
